			<h1>Just the Facts With J. Jonah Jameson</h1>
			<p>&nbsp; Welcome back, listeners, to another episode of Just the Facts with me, J. Jonah Jameson! Today, we're going to tackle a topic that's been itching at my nerves for far too long: Kirby. That's right, folks, you heard me correctly. Kirby. That pink puffball is nothing but a menace!
				<br>
				<br>
			Now, some of you might be scratching your heads and thinking, "But J. Jonah, isn't Kirby just an innocent little video game character?" Ha! Don't be fooled, my friends. That pint-sized troublemaker is nothing short of a menace to society.
				<br>
				<br>
			Let's start with the basics, shall we? Kirby's MO is simple: he goes around inhaling everything in sight, from innocent bystanders to valuable property. And what does he do with all that stolen loot? He uses it to wreak havoc on the unsuspecting citizens of Dream Land!
				<br>
				<br>
			But it doesn't stop there, folks. Oh no, Kirby's mischief knows no bounds. With his ability to copy the powers of his enemies, he becomes an unstoppable force of destruction, leaving chaos and mayhem in his wake.
				<br>
				<br>
			And let's not forget about his so-called "friends." Meta Knight, King Dedede – they're nothing but enablers, encouraging Kirby's reckless behavior at every turn. It's a disgrace, I tell you. A downright disgrace.
				<br>
				<br>
			Now, some may argue that Kirby is just a harmless character in a video game, but I'm here to tell you otherwise. His actions have consequences, folks. He's a symbol of everything that's wrong with society today – selfishness, greed, and a complete disregard for the rules.
				<br>
				<br>
			So, mark my words, listeners. We can't let Kirby continue to roam free, leaving a trail of destruction in his wake. It's time to hold him accountable for his actions and put an end to his reign of terror once and for all.
				<br>
				<br>
			Well, there you have it, folks. Another eye-opening episode of Just the Facts. Until next time, this is J. Jonah Jameson signing off. And remember, keep a close eye on that pink puffball. You never know where he'll strike next.</p>
